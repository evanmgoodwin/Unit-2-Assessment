# Challenge

With this updated macro, we can run the anaylsis of any given year much faster. The computer is able to loop through the entire data set only once, gathering information for each variable and storing it in memory. If we are given a data set three times as large as the current data set we have, it will still run faster with the new, refactored macro.
